# 查询重复数据根据单字段
```sql
select * from 表名 where id in 
( select id from 表名 group by id having count(1) >=2 )
```

# 查询重复数据根据多字段
```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	表名 a
WHERE
	(
		a.字段1,
		a.字段2
	) IN (
		SELECT
			字段1,
			字段2
		FROM
			表名
		GROUP BY
			字段1,
			字段2
		HAVING
			count(*) > 1
	)
```

删除重复记录的SQL：
```sql
DELETE
FROM
	表名
WHERE
	id IN (
		SELECT
			id
		FROM
			(
				SELECT
					id
				FROM
					表名 a
				WHERE
					(
						a.字段1,
						a.字段2
					) IN (
						SELECT
							字段1,
							字段2
						FROM
							表名
						GROUP BY
							字段1,
							字段2
						HAVING
							count(*) > 1
					)
				AND id NOT IN (
					SELECT
						min(id)
					FROM
						表名
					GROUP BY
						字段1,
						字段2
					HAVING
						count(*) > 1
				)
			) AS tmptb
